        I&apos;m a <Highlight>frontend developer</Highlight> whoâ€™s passionate about building clean, responsive, and impactful web applications that elevate user experience. With a strong foundation in the <Highlight>MERN stack,</Highlight> I love transforming ideas into modern, performance-driven products that solve real-world problems.

        I&apos;ve worked on a wide range of projects â€” from cloud-based note-taking apps and blog management systems to branding websites and Python-based tools like a YouTube video downloader. Whether it&apos;s implementing authentication, integrating rich text editors, managing complex UI state, or handling image uploads, I enjoy tackling challenges with code and creativity.

        I specialize in ReactJS, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I&apos;m always experimenting with tools like Docker, Clerk, Redux, and Google OAuth to stay ahead. Beyond just writing code, I focus on building reusable components, pixel-perfect UIs, and scalable architecture.

        I thrive in environments where I can continuously learn, push my limits, and contribute to meaningful digital experiences.
